Hey Jeff Coleman,

Last night Style threw a party at his house packed 
with an astonishing group...Mystery, Matador, all 
the Stylelife coaches, and other awesome people...it 
was a blast. Getting to watch the season 2 premiere 
episode of "The Pick-up Artist" with these guys was 
surreal. As you'll see...

I noticed Bravo taking a bunch of pictures at the 
party and asked him if he was putting them on the 
forum. He told me they were for Style's Pick-up 
labs. That project has been kept under the radar, 
but I can tell you this, Stylelife has been putting 
together a laboratory where you can experiment, 
examine, share and discuss old and new pick-up 
material for free. 

It's called Pickuplabs.com (http://pickuplabs.com). 
It's Stylelife's dedicated resource for developing 
and testing everything from canned DHVs to direct 
game. There will even be a special section for 
Stylelife students with powerful material developed 
by an undercover team. 

So how does this all relate to "The Pick-up Artist" 
show?

In the next couple of days you'll find detailed 
instructions, breakdowns and tests of the routines 
presented on the new season of "The Pick-up Artist." 
So, you can go out, test the routines, come back, 
and share your experiences.

You'll find out if you're ready to be on the show!

Bravo enlisted Joe D. (from Season 1) and some other 
Pick-up experts to get surprising insights about the 
show and the routines used in each episode. 

In the next weeks, features will be added so that 
you can upload your own routines and vote on other 
members' routines.

See you in the lab,
The Sneak

P.S :  Hit up www.pickuplabs.com right now and check 
out some of the pictures snapped at last night's 
party.

Dear MoveOn member,

To create the bold, progressive change America needs, a narrow victory
isn't enough.

We need a landslide.

The polls are shifting our way. And even though we can't take anything for
granted, it's worth all of us asking ourselves: if we really do have a
shot at a once-in-a-generation, history-changing election, how hard are we
willing to work?

Here's one thing you can do right now to help produce a landslide: grab
your phone, click this link, and spend a few minutes calling MoveOn
members in swing states and asking them to volunteer:

http://pol.moveon.org/obama/teams/index.html?id=14363-7977060-vgoyjCx&t=10

These calls are quick and easy to make, even if you've never called
before. We've heard from MoveOn members in swing states that these calls
are often all it takes to get them out to Obama offices to volunteer. In
just a few minutes, you can generate hours and hours of vote-winning
volunteer energy, right where it counts.

Remember Howard Dean's 50-state strategy? Remember Obama's speech in 2004,
declaring that there are no red states and blue states? This could be the
year that we redraw the political map. That we turn Colorado, North
Carolina, Indiana, Ohio, and Florida blue. This economic crisis is
reminding us that we're all in this together--and if we rise to the
moment, we could create the kind of political tidal wave that makes real,
deep change possible.

And here's something else worth keeping in mind: you can't steal a
landslide.

So let's keep pushing. Click here to start making calls:

http://pol.moveon.org/obama/teams/index.html?id=14363-7977060-vgoyjCx&t=11

Thanks for all you do.

--Adam, Michael, Ray, Andrea and the rest of the team

Want to support our work? We're entirely funded by our 4.2 million
members--no corporate contributions, no big checks from CEOs. And our tiny
staff ensures that small contributions go a long way. Chip in here.

You need to see some of the offensive attacks we're up against. I just =
recorded a short video on my laptop about John McCain's negative ads.

In the remaining 21 days, we need to be ready to respond to smears like =
these -- and worse.

We need to show that our supporters will fight back against the McCain =
campaign's low road tactics. That's why our goal is to bring 100,000 new =
donors into this movement before midnight on Friday, October 17th.

That means in Texas we need 5,000 new donors to step up this week.

Now is the time to make your first donation. This is your last opportunity =
to partner with a previous donor who will match every dollar.

Your donation of $5 becomes $10, $25 becomes $50, and $50 becomes $100 =
when it's matched by a fellow supporter. Watch the video and double your =
impact by making a matched donation today:

John McCain and his allies want smears and lies to drive this election.=20

answers for the issues that matter to ordinary people in Texas -- like the =
economy, health care, and ending the war in Iraq responsibly. And they've =

more offensive and baseless than the ones before.

The issues facing our country are too important to let our next president =

the real issues and focusing on false, negative attacks.

I'm attempting to deploy an application on my site colemanation.org
under the subdomain "backup.colemanation.org".

It points to "/backup/current/public" and I believe I have my
permissions set correctly, but I am receiving a message saying:

"We're sorry, but something went wrong."

I'm trying to deploy this app for a job interview so I'd like to get
it working soon.  Do you know what is causing the problem?

Thanks,
Jeff

</head><body><font face="arial,helvetica" style="font-family:
Verdana;"><font size="2" lang="0"> Hello BCers present and past! After a
month of basic admin integration and necessary but boring stuff like that,
Blogcritics writers and editors now get our first crack at a major
Technorati project, which will really turbo all of the cool things about
the new relationship and shine a very bright spotlight on those who choose
to participate. <br /> <br /> What is the project? Many, if not most,
bloggers use &quot;tags&quot; on their blogs: simple keywords to help
associate similar posts. Technorati tracks these tags and compiles
information based on their usage into &quot;tag pages,&quot; such as this
one: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/iphone"
target="_blank">http://technorati.com/tag/<wbr></wbr>iphone</a> or this
one: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/blogcritics"
target="_blank">http://technorati.com/tag/<wbr></wbr>blogcritics</a><br />
<br /> Right now those look very much like search results pages, but soon
Technorati will be launching a new design for their tag pages, read by
millions every month. We get to add brief but pithy descriptions of the
most popular tags, calling them, for lack of a more creative name,
&quot;Tag Descriptions.&quot;<br /> <br /> Your tag description should tell
the reader the basics of that tag and why that particular tag is popular
within the blogosphere. Tag Descriptions will have a very long shelf life
and the style for these needs to be information rich and succinct, just
100-200 words.<br /> <br /> The Tag Descriptions you write will feature
your byline, linked to your BC Writer Page, bringing recognition and
traffic to YOU. You will also be seen as the definitive expert on that tag
subject. Also, if you've written a relevant article on the subject for the
BC network, you can link to your own article. Juicy!<br /> <br /> More
guidelines:<br /> <br /> Cover the most relevant aspects of the tag first -
why does this tag get used so often? <br /> <br /> Think time-neutral.
Don't describe someone's age, list their birth year. These descriptions
will live for years as evergreen content.<br /> <br /> We need links - at
least three per tag description. Try to include one link per factual
statement. Try to include one link to another Technorati tag page, and one
link to an article or post on the Blogcritics network, where possible. Link
to your own article where relevant. Favor links to blogs over static sites.
Do not link to any single site more than once.<br /> <br /> Tag description
samples can be found at <a href="../../../../mt/samples.php"
target="_blank">http://blogcritics.org/mt/<wbr></wbr>samples.php</a> Please
read the samples and the light of revelation will shine forth!<br /> <br />
The edit screen for Tag Descriptions is very streamlined. There are no
sections, categories, or Amazon ASINs; nothing but the text itself. To see
the list of available tags, visit <a href="../../../../mt/taglist.php"
target="_blank">http://blogcritics.org/mt/<wbr></wbr>taglist.php</a>
They're sorted in priority order, with more heavily-trafficked tags
first.<br /> <br /> Visit that list, pick a tag (or tags) about which you
know something, and click the &quot;Open&quot; link (or the little pencil
icon to the left) next to the tag. Save the empty article right away to
claim that tag for yourself. The little book icon to the left will take you
to the existing Technorati tag page so you can find out what the
blogosphere is saying right now, and maybe incorporate some of that into
your Tag Description.<br /> <br /> We have been charged with writing and
publishing 500 of these before November 1, when the new tag page design
will be rolled out. We can do it, but we need everyone to pitch in. Thanks
as always, and please fell free to ask questions, make suggestions, etc!<br

Hello Jeff,

I could find that there was some problem with the deployment of your application. The shebang line for the dispatch file was not set correctly. I have made the changes now. Also in your environment.rb file the the variable 'env' was defined incorrectly. I have corrected it now. But when I access your application at http://backup.colemanation.org I'm getting the error in connecting to your mysql database. For more information on the error you can check your production.log file
==========================================================================================================================
Mysql::Error (Access denied for user 'jcoleman_root'@'localhost' to database 'jcoleman_mailprod'):
    /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/activerecord-2.1.0/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/mysql_adapter.rb:505:in `real_connect'

Make sure that the you have added the mysql database from your Cpanel and have given the correct information of it in the database.yml file.

Woot!  Thanks.  I hadn't set the permissions on the database.  It's up
and running now.  Thanks again.

I have another question, that might help me track down a related issue.

Does my application have permissions to create files on the server?
My app is intending to read from a POP3 account and create a text file
with the emails on it, then allow the user to download that file.

Do I have permissions to create the file that way?

In my backup_controller.rb I use the following line to open the file:

File.open("public/#{@filename}", File::CREAT|File::TRUNC|File::WRONLY) do |file|

Will this create the file?

Thanks.
